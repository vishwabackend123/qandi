                                <p>JEE is one of the most prestigious and challenging entrance examinations in the country. Lakhs of students appear for the exam every year to get admission in the best Engineering colleges.

The sessions will be held from 23rd to 26th February 2021, 15th to 18th March, 27th to 30th April, and 24th to 28th May 2021.

                                <p> Following are some important points and major changes in JEE Main 2021:</p>
                                <p> _Candidates can apply for one or more sessions together and pay the exam fee accordingly.</p>
                                <p>_Candidates can choose to apply for one session at a time, they can apply again for the remaining session when the application window reopens after the declaration of the last held session.</p>
                                <p> _If a candidate doesn’t want to appear for the session for which the fee is already paid, they will have to make a request during the application process and the amount will be refunded by NTA.</p>
                                <p> _If any candidate appears for more than one session, then their best score our of the multiple attempts will be considered for preparation of merit list/ ranking.</p>
                                <p> _JEE Main 2021 exam pattern has been revised and the total number of questions will now be 90, unlike 75 in 2019. However, they need to attempt only 75 questions out of the total 90 questions.</p>
